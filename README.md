2) Hatsune Miku:
Hatsune Miku is a 16 year old vocaloid software voicebank. When performing, she uses a VSTI plug-in called Piapro Studio (a singing synthesizer). In addition to this, her voice is modeled from Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita. As a perfomer, I think that she appeals to her audience and her movements help her during her perfomrance because she seems to be very energetic. This helps the fans stay engaged at her concerts so that way throughout the whole performance it is a great experience. Also she has a wide variety of movements per song so that way there is always something new for the audience to see when watching her perform and she keeps good lighting during her peformance so this will increase the excitement among the audience which will result in more success for future perfomrances because people will want to come back for encores.
